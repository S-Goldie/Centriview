# Centriview
Visual tools for understanding the motion of 2D nanosheets in a centrifugal field.
The theoretical basis and experimental data underpinning these tools are currently available as a pre-print. For further details on the derivation and detail discussion of the model, please click [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05111).

## Contents
* Python scripts for deployment of WebApp to visualise population changes using the Streamlit package.
* Experimental data files from cascade centrifuge experiments.
* Solvent data repository for density and viscosity calculations.

The Centriview tool is more suitable as a deployed webapp, _coming soon_. However, the source code is available here.
Additional features may be explored as branches while a stable deployment will be maintained in the `main` branch.


_The tools and data files made available within this repository were supported by funding from the European Union (2D-PRINTABLE HE: 101135196)_
_If any use of these tools is made for published work please reference our accompanying publication._
