# Centriview
Visual tools for understanding the motion of 2D nanosheets in a centrifugal field.

## Contents
* Python scripts for analysis
* WebApp production for visualising the model
* Working data files while model validation in progress

Because we are still validating and working to fully understand the model this will serve as a central data and analysis repository, as well as holding the working progress of the WebApp. Once our understanding of the model is complete, many of those files can be removed to leave a clean repository of analysis code and WebApp files.
