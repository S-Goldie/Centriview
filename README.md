# Centriview
Visual tools for understanding the motion of 2D nanosheets in a centrifugal field.
Build version 0.2, in development. Multi-page application functions with complete nested folder structure as visualisation and computational tool.

## Contents
* Python scripts for analysis
* Working data files while model validation in progress
* Solvent data repository for density and viscosity calculations

Because we are still validating and working to fully understand the model this will serve as a central data and analysis repository, as well as holding the working progress of the WebApp. Once our understanding of the model is complete, many of those files can be removed to leave a clean repository of analysis code and WebApp files.
