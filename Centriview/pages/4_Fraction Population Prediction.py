                The function calculated from the experimental parameters above describes the _change_ in 
                nanosheet size distribution after centrifugation. A high percentage remaining indicates 
                retention of nanosheets of that size, while a low percentage indicates they are likely 
                to be discarded. By changing the experimental parameters it is possible to predict the 
                effect of different centrifugation conditions. In a rigorous treatment, this function of 
                centrifuge parameters and nanosheet sizes should be multiplied by the starting nanosheet size 
                distribution to predict the final distribution. However, since this is very rarely known 
                we simply plot the change that a given centrifuge process will cause.
                    
                To more easily visualize this change to the nanosheet size distribution, we can use the
                most common aspect-ratios known for liquid-phase exfoliated nanosheets to reduce the

        For nanosheets prepared by other techniques, the flake area and thickness may not be related 
        by the same aspect-ratios as known for liquid phase exfoliation samples. In this case, the full 
        3D surface describing the percentage of flakes remaining as a function of lateral size and thickness, 
        as separate variables, is a more accurate description.   
                    
        To make such 3D surfaces readable, they are shown here as 2D contour plots. In regions beyond the dark 
        blue lines, no flakes of such size will remain after centrifugation, while inside the two orange 
        contour lines the highest population will be retained. (If only one orange line is shown, the speeds 
        selected are too low to remove the largest flakes.)
                
        To more easily understand this plot, it can be useful to refer to the line plot above. This follows 
        the 3D surface over a path described by fixed aspect ratios. This path is shown as the grey dashed
        line through the contour plot. The peak, corresponding to the highest population remaining, should fall 
        within the boundaries of the orange lines whilst the function decays to zero beyond the blue boundaries.
